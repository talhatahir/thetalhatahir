Today i am going to tell you how to integrate Sentry with **ReactJS** and further publish Sentry Releases to enhance issue tagging.

**Lets enlighten you!**

Before we begin, i have setup React using CRA (*Create React App) *and i use yarn as my package manager ( recommended by Facebook )

## 1- Install Sentry browser plugin

```js
yarn add [@sentry/browser](http://twitter.com/sentry/browser)
```

Once installed. You need to initiate sentry before you load your App so that it start listening for errors.

In **App.js** do the following:

```js
if (process.env.REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: process.env.REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN,
    environment: process.env.REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT,
    release: process.env.REACT_APP_BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER,
  });
}
```

dsn is your project dsn available under sentry project settings and environment is your build environment : development, production, staging.

release is a string which represents your current build number. Since we would be using bitbucket pipelines so i would tell you later how to get this dynamic build number to your React code.

Now in order to catch exceptions, you need to Add Sentry to your **ErrorBoundary.js** like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null, errorInfo: null };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    this.setState({ error, errorInfo });
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }

  render() {
    const { error, errorInfo } = this.state;
    const { children } = this.props;

    if (errorInfo) {
      return <div>Something went wrong</div>;
    }

    return children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

## 2. Generate **Sentry Auth Token**

Go to [https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/)

Generate an auth token which is required to authorize your pipeline code to make a release on sentry.

**Note:** This Auth Token is different from other API tokens generated in sentry.io and is only available at the above link. Please do not confuse it with them\*

## 3. Add variables to bitbucket **deployment** settings

You need to add following variables to your pipeline settings with their values so that sentry-cli can access them.

```js
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN = your - token - value;

SENTRY_ORG = your - sentry - organisation - name;

SENTRY_FRONTEND_PROJECT = your - sentry - project - name;

SENTRY_BACKEND_PROJECT = your - sentry - project - name;
```

**Note:** If you have a single Project in Sentry to which you want to send errors then simply add SENTRY_PROJECT . I am using two Sentry projects, one to log backend/API errors and the other to log Frontend/React Errors.

## 4. Add Sentry-cli commands to your Bitbucket Pipeline.

In your pipeline, add the below step, which should be the first step in your pipeline:

```js
    - step:
       name: Sentry Release
       image: getsentry/sentry-cli
      script:
       - sentry-cli releases -o "${SENTRY_ORG}" new -p "${SENTRY_BACKEND_PROJECT}" -p "${SENTRY_FRONTEND_PROJECT}" "${BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER}"
       - sentry-cli releases -o "${SENTRY_ORG}" set-commits --auto "${BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER}"
```

Now the next step is to pass the auto-generated BITBUCKET _BUILD_NUMBER_ to your React build compile command. In this way you are able to provide the bitbucket build number to your _Sentry.init_ function.

```js
    - step:
    name: Build React
    image: node:10.16.3
    caches:
       - node
    script:
       - cd frontend/
       - yarn install
       - REACT_APP_BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER=${BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER} yarn build
```

Now we need to finalize the Sentry Release by adding this step to the last section of our pipeline script.

```js
    - step:
    name: Finalize and Deploy Sentry Release
    image: getsentry/sentry-cli
    script:
      - sentry-cli releases finalize "${BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER}"
      - sentry-cli releases deploys "${BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER}" new -e "production"
```

_and thats it!_

**Note:** <code>argument</code> is used to define the environment : production, staging, development.

Viewing releases in Sentry:

Go to your Sentry Dashboard -> Releases

And you can see your first Sentry release ðŸ˜ƒ
