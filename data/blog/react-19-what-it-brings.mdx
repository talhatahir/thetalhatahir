React 19 is a quality-of-life and ergonomics release that polishes the everyday developer workflow while unlocking better user experiences. If you already write React apps, the headline features will likely help you ship faster with less boilerplate.

## TL;DR

- **Actions for forms and mutations**: Simpler server/client mutations and form handling with progressive enhancement.
- **`useActionState` and `useOptimistic`**: First-class ergonomics for pending and optimistic UI states.
- **`use()` hook**: A standard way to read async resources (suspends while loading) in components.
- **Document Metadata**: Built-in support for setting document metadata from React.
- **Web Components**: Better compatibility and typing for custom elements and events.
- **Better hydration errors**: Clearer diffs and messages when server and client HTML diverge.

If you’re deciding between React and a framework, read my comparison in [ReactJS vs NextJS: Which One to Choose?](../blog/reactjs-vs-nextjs) and make sure you’re solid on the basics in [Before you start using ReactJS](../blog/before-you-use-react-js).

## Actions: simpler mutations and forms

React 19 standardizes the idea of an “action” for progressive, accessible form handling and mutations. You can attach an action directly to a `<form>` or a `<button formAction>` and React will coordinate the submission lifecycle, pending state, and errors.

```tsx
// Example: form with an action and optimistic UI
import { useActionState, useOptimistic } from 'react'

type Comment = { id: string; text: string }

async function addComment(prevState: string | null, formData: FormData) {
  'use server' // if you’re in a framework with server functions; omit otherwise
  const text = String(formData.get('text') || '')
  if (!text.trim()) return 'Comment cannot be empty'
  // persist to your backend here
  return null
}

export default function CommentForm() {
  const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(addComment, null)
  const [optimisticComments, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic<Comment[]>([], (state, newText: string) => [
    { id: 'optimistic-' + Date.now(), text: newText },
    ...state,
  ])

  return (
    <form action={submitAction} onSubmit={(e) => {
      const input = (e.currentTarget.elements.namedItem('text') as HTMLInputElement)
      addOptimistic(input.value)
    }}>
      <input name="text" placeholder="Write a comment" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>Post</button>
      {error && <p role="alert">{error}</p>}
      <ul>
        {optimisticComments.map((c) => (
          <li key={c.id}>{c.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Why it matters:

- Less custom state plumbing for pending, success, and error cases
- Works great with progressive enhancement and accessibility
- Encourages optimistic UIs with minimal code

## The `use()` hook for async boundaries

`use()` lets a component read an async value and suspend while it loads. It plays nicely with Suspense and streaming.

```tsx
import { use } from 'react'

function fetchUser(userId: string) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then((r) => r.json())
}

export function UserCard({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const user = use(fetchUser(userId))
  return <div>{user.name}</div>
}
```

Use it when you want simple, per-component data reads without wiring external state libraries.

## Document Metadata in React

React 19 brings built-in support for setting metadata like `<title>` and `<meta>` from your components (especially useful with streaming/SSR). You can define page metadata alongside the UI tree without ad-hoc head managers.

Practical effect: cleaner SEO plumbing and fewer head-management dependencies.

If SEO is your focus, also see my tips in [How to boost productivity as a programmer](../blog/boost-productivity-as-programmer) where I share practical workflows that help you ship faster and iterate more.

## Better Web Components support

React 19 improves interop with custom elements: props/attributes mapping is more predictable, event handling is smoother, and TypeScript support is better for custom events. If your design system is a set of Web Components, interop friction is much lower now.

## Hydration error messages you can act on

When server-rendered HTML and client render disagree, hydration errors now include clearer diffs and guidance so you can quickly isolate what drifted.

## Should you upgrade?

If you’re on React 18, moving to 19 should be straightforward for most apps. Start by adopting Actions in your most common forms and add `useOptimistic` where latency is noticeable. Then gradually introduce `use()` for simple data reads behind Suspense.

If you’re picking a framework to pair with React, revisit [ReactJS vs NextJS](../blog/reactjs-vs-nextjs) for trade-offs, and read [Before you start using ReactJS](../blog/before-you-use-react-js) to make sure your fundamentals are solid.

### FAQ

**Is React 19 a breaking release?**

Most apps upgrade smoothly. Skim the official notes for any deprecations that affect your codebase.

**Do I need a framework to use Actions?**

No, Actions are part of React’s model for forms and submissions. Frameworks may add conveniences on top (e.g., server functions).

**Does `use()` replace my data fetching library?**

No. It’s a primitive that pairs nicely with Suspense. Use it where it simplifies your component code.
