This is the era of remote work! You might already be aware of many websites that hire remotely, but there is a caveat: most companies hire remotely only in specific locations, or they have specific time zones in which they hire. This reduces the number of available jobs. A truly remote job should not have timezone restrictions, or location restrictions, and should offer flexible hours. Once you've found the right platforms, learn [How I applied to hundreds of Jobs in a few clicks](../blog/applying-to-hundred-jobs-quickly) to streamline your application process.

I have curated a list of websites that offer truly 100% global remote jobs.

## WWR - WeWorkRemotely

WeWorkRemotely is an excellent website to begin your search for truly remote jobs. It serves as a platform where many remote-first companies post job listings with no restrictions on the location where you want to work. They have curated lists for programming roles: `Frontend`, `Backend`, and `Fullstack` jobs. The listings generally get updated every 3-4 hours, so keep an eye on upcoming jobs.

## Nowhiteboard.org

This is a non-profit website that shows companies who do not have the old standard whiteboard interviews, such as _online live coding_, _online pair programming_, or _whiteboard questions_. If you are looking for a job at a company that hires without all these nonsense interview techniques, then this is the site for you. You can just select the remote filter and add your category of job, and it will show you all the remote jobs available. You would then have to check for yourself whether the employer hires globally or in specific remote locations.
