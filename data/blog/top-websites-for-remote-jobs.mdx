This is the era of remote work!

You might already be aware of many websites that hire remotely, but there is a caveat: most companies hire remotely only in specific locations, or they have specific time zones in which they hire. This reduces the number of available jobs. A truly remote job should not have timezone restrictions, or location restrictions, and should offer flexible hours.

I have curated a list of websites that offer truly 100% global remote jobs.

## WWR - WeWorkRemotely

WeWorkRemotely is an excellent website to begin your search for truly remote jobs. It serves as a platform where many remote-first companies post job listings with no restrictions on the location where you want to work from. They have curated lists for programming roles: `Frontend`, `Backend`, and `Fullstack` jobs. The listings generally get updated every 3-4 hours, so keep an eye on upcoming jobs.

## RemoteOk.com

RemoteOk.com is another valuable resource for finding global remote jobs. By simply selecting the `Worldwide` filter, you gain access to a comprehensive list of remote job opportunities offered by companies that hire globally. To stay informed about new remote job postings, you can easily sign up on the website to receive regular updates.

## DailyRemote.com

If you're looking for remote jobs beyond the engineering field, DailyRemote.com is an ideal aggregator website to consider. It offers a diverse range of remote job listings across different industries. By setting your location to `Worldwide` and selecting the category as `Software Development`, you can specifically explore remote software development roles. The platform's extensive job database makes it a highly recommended resource for finding remote work opportunities tailored to your skill set and interests.

## TrulyRemote.co

TrulyRemote.co is a reliable platform that hosts a vast selection of remote job listings. Each job posting includes information about the location preferences of the employer. Simply look for the `Worldwide` tag associated with the listings. The website offers a hassle-free experience without requiring any sign-up process, allowing you to focus on finding suitable remote job opportunities and applying directly.

## Himalayas

This is a huge portal that contains companies, online talent, and, most importantly, remote jobs. You just need to go to their `jobs` section, select `100% remote`, and finally, select your category of job. It gets updated every hour, so be sure to keep a lookout for global remote jobs on this one.

## JSJobbs.com

If you are looking for jobs specific to the JavaScript language, then this is the site to be at. It's curated for JS-related jobs only. You can select filters to search for global remote jobs.

## JustRemote.co

Another fantastic website for purely remote jobs, each job mentions where the employer is looking for candidates in. You can find many Software Engineering jobs on this portal.

## Nowhiteboard.org

This is a non-profit website that shows companies who do not have the old standard whiteboard interviews, such as _online live coding_, _online pair programming_, or _whiteboard questions_. If you are looking for a job at a company that hires without all these nonsense interview techniques, then this is the site for you. You can just select the remote filter and add your category of job, and it will show you all the remote jobs available. You would then have to check for yourself whether the employer hires globally or in specific remote locations.
