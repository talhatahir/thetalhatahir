## Your Data, Your Control

When I built Jobfillr, privacy was one of my top priorities. As a developer, I've seen how many browser extensions collect and store user data on their servers, often without being fully transparent about it. I wanted to do things differently. That's why I deliberately designed Jobfillr to keep all your personal information strictly within your own browser - your email, phone number, work history, and other sensitive details never leave your local storage. No cloud servers, no data collection, just a simple tool that respects your privacy while making job applications easier. It's the same approach I would want as a user myself.

## Looking Forward

[Jobfillr](https://www.jobfillr.com) is continuously evolving, with new features and improvements being added regularly. My goal is to make the job application process as smooth as possible, allowing you to focus on finding the right opportunity rather than getting bogged down by form filling.
