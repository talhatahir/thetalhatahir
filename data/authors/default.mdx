An accomplished Engineer with a deep passion for software development and product building. With an experience spanning over a decade in the software industry, I've developed expertise in full-stack development and building scalable solutions that drive business growth.

I have had the privilege of collaborating with diverse startups and bootstrapped companies across multiple domains inluding SaaS, HealthTech and E-commerce. From early-stage ventures securing Series A funding to well-established companies backed attaining Unicorn status, I've witnessed firsthand the evolution and maturation of products. This journey has equipped me with invaluable insights into building robust architectures, managing technical debt, and scaling engineering teams.

My technical expertise includes:
- Frontend Development: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
- Backend Development: Node.js, PHP, Laravel
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- CI/CD: Github Actions, CircleCI
- Cloud: AWS
- Database Systems: MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Outside of work, I indulge in a variety of hobbies and interests. I am a passionate chess enthusiast, playing or spectating games on chess.com, where I enjoy analyzing strategies and participating in online tournaments. When it comes to sports, tennis takes center stage - I eagerly follow the legendary player Roger Federer, widely regarded as the original Greatest of All Time (GOAT). His precision, grace, and sportsmanship continue to inspire me both on and off the court.

I find solace and joy in nature. Exploring mountains is a cherished pastime, where I can immerse myself in the serene beauty of the natural world. Some of my memorable hiking experiences include trails in the northern areas of Pakistan, each offering unique challenges and breathtaking views. Physical fitness is also important to me, so hitting the gym regularly helps maintain both physical and mental well-being.

As a firm believer in giving back to the community, I actively mentor aspiring developers and contribute to open-source projects. I do pro bono consulting for Software Projects, particularly focusing on early-stage startups and non-profit organizations.
